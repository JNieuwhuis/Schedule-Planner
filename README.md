# Schedule-Planner
Schedule Planner Assignment 

Schedule planner
In this exercise, we will create a week schedule. A week schedule consists of five day schedules. A day schedule consists of an arbitrary amount of schedule items. A schedule item, in this simplification, has a name (description) and a duration.

Write a program that can:

- schedule tasks on a given week day,
- calculate the total amount of time spent on tasks during a day,
- calculate the total amount of time spent on tasks during the week,
- warn the user if they go into overtime (> 9 hours in a day, or > 40 hours in a week).

We assume that any overhead between tasks is negligible and that there is no ordering in tasks.

Learning goals:
- Immutable data
- Storing related data in containers in a collection
- Time API
